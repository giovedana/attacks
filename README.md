Zeroth Order Attacks

This project was created in the context of an university assigment. 
We were asked to study and compare different algorithm in order to perform adversarial attack on a neural network.
The folder consegna ods contains the Matlab implementation of the project:

- preliminaries 	file to execute in order to have the right set up
- Algo2 		implementation of stochastic FW based attack
- Det_FW		implementation of deterministic zeroth order FW
- FW_black		implementation of FW based attack
- ORD			implementation of ORD
- experiments_*		attacking 100 istances in order to obtain performances of the algo *
- distorsion_*		computation of mean distortion of the algo *
